 Riwux baseutils
+================+

The baseutils project aims to provide a minimal but complete commandline
environment containing utilities found on most UNIX(-like) systems.
It's goal is to be simple, portable and compliant while still being pleasant
to use. Features and extensions are chosen carefully and only implemented if
they are either (very) common or provide real value to the user.
One of those features is UTF-8 compliance, which improves the usability by
a lot.

In its finished state, it should be possible to build and compile
a (e.g Linux-) distribution with it.


 Modules
+========+

baseutils is split into several different subdirectories (i.e modules),
each dedicated to a specific standard or group of tools.
Below is a list of subdirectories and the corresponding tools that are
already implemented. For details, check the man-page of the utility.

posix/  -- POSIX.1-2017 utilities
extra/  -- common non-standard utilities


 Build
+======+

Supported compilers:
  - clang (out of the box)
  - gcc   (out of the box)
  - tcc   (out of the box)
  - nwcc  (out of the box)
  - pcc   (remove -s from $(LDFLAGS))
  - lacc  (remove -s from $(LDFLAGS))

To build baseutils, follow these instructions:

    $ make            # build the whole project
    $ make all        # same as above

    $ make install    # install utilities
    $ make uninstall  # uninstall utilities
    $ make clean      # remove all binaries and build leftovers

    $ make posix  # only build POSIX utilities
    $ make extra  # only build non-standard / extra utilities
    $ make lib    # only build libraries (in lib/)

In case you want to customize your build process, change the corresponding
values in config.mak or directly on the commandline.
